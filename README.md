# Incremental Analytics Pipeline

A small, incremental project that builds core Data Engineering & DataOps skills:
- CI/CD (Stage 1)
- API extraction (Stage 2)
- Pandas transformations (Stage 3)
- Data quality checks (Stage 4)
- Produce final analytics table (Stage 5)

This project intentionally focuses on *one skill at a time*.

## Stage 1: CI/CD
- A tiny function that cleans a column from input.csv
- Pipeline runs tests, linting, formatting, and executes the script
